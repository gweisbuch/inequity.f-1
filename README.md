      \begin{abstract}
We discuss a model of inequity based on iteration 
of the Nash multi--agent bargaining game on a lattice.
Agent's choices are based on a logit function and 
gradual decay of memories of past profits.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the stability   
of various dynamical regimes, such as disorder, fairness or inequity,
%%separated by transitions
according to parameters and initial conditions.
When playing the game on a lattice 
i.e. using neighbouring agent interactions instead of
random interaction among the whole agent population,
one observes spatial domains and specific patterns
 in addition to the temporal convergence toward attractors
 observed when interactions involve any pair of agents.
  A result specific to the network topology is the co-existence
   of domains with different regimes, allowing the emergence
 of the inequity condition even in the absence of tags.
